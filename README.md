# Recipes Project with Ruby on Rails Project and a React Frontend

In this project, I created a Ruby on Rails application that stores 
your favorite recipes then displays them with a React frontend. User can create, view, and delete recipes from its profile. It is created with React and user interface is styled with Bootstrap.
